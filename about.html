        <p>Kappa Phi is an organization for Christian university women. The first chapter was founded in 1916 at the University of Kansas. Today, there are 28 active chapters. Kappa Phi was originally affiliated with the United Methodist Church, but today includes women from a wide variety of church backgrounds. Each chapter has a Sponsor, who is an older woman, often a Kappa Phi alumna, that mentors the current members. Chapters are divided into three regions called Koras. Many members and alumnae attend Kora and National conferences. Even after graduation, members often live by one of Kappa Phi's slogans, "Sisters in Christ, Sisters for Life."

        The University of Mount Union is the home of the Alpha Psi chapter. Our chapter was founded in 1969. Throughout the years, membership has ranged anywhere between 5-90 members. Currently, our chapter has been working very hard after a dip and has about 30 members. We have recruitment each Fall and Spring semester. To join, you must be a current female student at Mount Union. To get in contact with our Pledge Coordinators, please head over to the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>

        Our Pillars
        </h1>
        <p>Kappa Phi has four pillars, which are the foundation of our organization.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Service: </b>We participate in many service projects to help our campus and communities. Some of Alpha Psi's favorite projects are: stuffing plastic eggs for the local Easter egg hunt; packaging meals for underdeveloped countries through Stop Hunger Now; and making cards for local senior centers and members of the military.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Worship: </b>Being a Christian organization, we take time to worship God through devotions, praise songs, and prayer. Another Kappa Phi slogan is "Lights in the darkness, o God help us be." We hope that others can see the light of Jesus through us!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Fellowship: </b>College girls love to hang out! We often get together for craft and movie nights. We also love to eat! By enjoying each other's company, we create a safe community where we can share the joys and concerns of our lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Study: </b>The study pillar is two-fold. Firstly, some of our weekly meetings also serve as Bible studies. Each year, the National organization has a theme that helps us work through a topic and verses that we can apply to our lives. Secondly, members are very dedicated to their schoolwork. Although we don't have a required GPA, many sisters have study groups or tutor other members because we all hope to be successful in our fields.</p>
