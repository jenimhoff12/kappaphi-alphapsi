        <h1>Members</h1>
        <p>For many members, joining Kappa Phi was one of the best decisions they have made while at Mount Union. Sisters participate in service projects, Bible studies, craft nights, tailgates, and so much more! You can also join our leadership team. From Social Media Coordinator to President, there is bound to be a position that fits your talents.

            <h2>Becoming a Member</h2>
            <br>
            Each semester, we hold recruitment for new members. The Rose Tea is our official kick-off. All Mount Union women are invited for a time of food, fellowship, and a chance to learn about what is Kappa Phi. Nest, new members go through our Pledge Ceremony, Degree of the Pine. For the next six weeks, new members participate in Pledge class to learn more about our organization. Finally, the new members go through the Degree of the Light, where they become full-fledged active members! To celebrate the occasion, Alpha Psi has a tradition of going to Applebees for late-night appetizers and dessert. <br><br>

              <h2>Graduating to an Alumna</h2>
              <br>
              When it is time to graduate, Seniors go through Degree of the Rose. They leave underclassmen with words of encouragement and wishes for Alpha Psi and their own futures. Each Senior is presented a pink rose, which represents the love that unites the members. This symbolizes that although they may be graduating, Kappa Phi members are "Sisters in Christ, Sisters for Life." New alumnae have the opportunity to join Alum chapters, which are organized by regions and cities.<br>
